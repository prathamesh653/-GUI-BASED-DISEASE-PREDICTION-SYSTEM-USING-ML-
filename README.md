# -GUI-BASED-DISEASE-PREDICTION-SYSTEM-USING-ML-
📌 Project Overview

The GUI-Based Disease Prediction System is a desktop application that predicts possible diseases based on symptoms entered by the user. It leverages Machine Learning algorithms and provides an easy-to-use Tkinter GUI for interaction.

This project demonstrates how ML models like Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Naive Bayes can be applied to healthcare data to assist in early diagnosis and awareness.

✨ Features

✅ User-friendly Tkinter-based GUI

✅ Disease prediction from symptoms

✅ Multiple ML models for better accuracy

✅ CSV dataset handling

✅ Comparison of model performance

✅ Instant prediction results

🛠️ Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python

Libraries:

Tkinter → GUI design

Pandas → Dataset handling

Scikit-learn → Machine Learning models

NumPy → Data processing

Dataset: Medical diagnosis dataset (Symptoms → Disease mapping)

⚙️ Workflow

Input Symptoms → User selects symptoms from the GUI.

Data Preprocessing → Dataset is cleaned and prepared.

Model Training → ML models (Decision Tree, Random Forest, Naive Bayes) are trained.

Prediction → The trained model predicts the most probable disease.

Result Display → Predicted disease is shown in the GUI.
